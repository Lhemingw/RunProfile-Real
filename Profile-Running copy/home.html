        This included teachers along with kids both wanted me to fail. 
        They both did really good job making sure I did later on in adulthood.  
        I grew up not knowing what success was, seeing my brother 
        being successful by running I wanted to try to see if 
        I could learn success after all I was forced to realize I was always a loser, 
        will always be by people.  I knew if I found one success I can bring it into all my life.</p></div>
