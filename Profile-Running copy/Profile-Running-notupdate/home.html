        <p class="box">Someone that was raised in the 80's with a learning disability 
        that was not diagnosed was not in *existing a person was *torrcered a lot being "Too wierd."  
        This included teachers along with kids both wanted me to fail. 
        They both did really good job making sure I did later on in adulthood.  
        I grew up not knowing what success was, seeing my brother 
        being successful by running I wanted to try to see if 
        I could learn success after all I was forced to realize I was always a loser, 
        will always be by people.  I knew if I found one success I can bring it into all my life.</p>
