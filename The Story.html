            This race was the Spaceport Relay 24-hour race. We raced from El Paso, Texas, to the Spaceport, NM. 
            A friend called me to let me know that The Ultimate Gift of Life was going to run this to advertise. 
            Our goal was to have a 12-person team, but we only got 6, and the sixth one was last minute because 
            someone couldn't do it. Staying up, not getting much sleep, not having a team (until David called me), 
            and running more mileage than I ever ran before were scary concepts. This was one of the best things 
            I have done in my entire life.
