            <div class="box"> 
                <p class="box"> Growing up in the 1980s with an undiagnosed learning disability was a challenging experience. As a child, I was often labeled as "too weird" and faced frequent torment from both peers and teachers. 
                    Their lack of understanding and support created an environment where I struggled to thrive.
                    The constant criticism and lack of proper guidance took a toll on my self-esteem, affecting my ability to succeed even into adulthood. 
                    I grew up without a clear concept of what success meant or how to achieve it. Watching my brother's accomplishments in running inspired me to seek my own path to success.
                    Despite years of being made to feel like a failure, I realized that finding even one area where I could excel could potentially transform my entire life. 
                    This realization sparked a determination to overcome the negative perceptions imposed on me and discover my own potential for success.
